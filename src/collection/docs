Collection is used for store and manipulate the group of objects..

The Iterable is root interface of all collection classes, It is used for iterating data in forward direction only, It has 3 methods 1-hasNext(), 2-next(), 3-remove()

The collection is an Interface. It implements 3 Interface (1)-List (3)-Set (3)-Queue 

List has 4 class, 1-ArrayList 2-LinkedList 3-Vector 4-Stack

Set has 3 class, 1-HashSet 2-LinkedHashSet 3-TreeSet


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--> ArrayList :-
It has 3 constructors 1-ArrayList() 2-ArrayList(Collection c) 3-ArrayList(int capacity)
It don't allow duplicate values
It maintains Insertion order
The initial capacity is 10 and load factor is 100% or 1.


--> LinkedList :-
Same as ArrayList but different in internal working...


--> HashSet :-
The HashSet class extends AbstractSet class which implements Set interface.
The Set interface inherits Collection and Iterable interfaces in hierarchical order.
A List can contain duplicate elements whereas Set contains unique elements only.
It don't allow duplicates, It contains only unique values..
It allows null value.
It not maintain the insertion order.
It is best for search operation.
The initial capacity is 16 and load factor is 0.75 or 70%


--> TreeSet :-
TreeSet class contains unique elements only like HashSet.
TreeSet class access and retrieval times are quite fast.
TreeSet class doesn't allow null elements.
TreeSet class is non-synchronized.
TreeSet class maintains ascending order.
In TreeSet heterogeneous is not allowed.. 

It internally uses a binary search tree, and it stores data into tree format.
If the element is bigger then current then it will store to right side,
and If element is lesser then current then it will store to left side..

It implements the SortedSet Set Interface, it has some special methods, like..
first(), last(), headSet(), tailSet(), subSet(), comparator(), this all methods explained while executing it..
