A class is declared inside class that is called Inner class or nested class..

--> We use Inner classes to logically group classes and interfaces in one place to be more readable and maintainable.


	Advantages Of Nested Classes : 
-> The nested classes can access all data members and methods including private also of outer class..
-> The Nested classes are used to develop readable and maintainable code.
-> The Nested classes requires the less code to write.
 

	Type of Nested Classes : 
	(Non - static)
-> Member Inner Class	-> A class which created within class and outside method..
-> Anonymous Inner Class-> A class created for implementing an interface or extending class. The java compiler decides its name..
-> Local Inner Class	-> A class which create within method..

-> Static Nested Class	-> A static class which created within class..

-> Nested Interface		-> An Interface which created within Interface or class..

	df bw Nested and Inner Class :
-> The nested class don't require a object is that like static where as Inner class requires a object is that like non-static..

	Member Class :
-> A non-static class which created within class but outside the method that is known as member inner class or regular inner class..


	Anonymous Class :
-> A class which has no name that is known as Anonymous Inner Class. It can create with Abstract or concrete class and Interface..

--> Whatever we gave name to the Anonymous Inner Class but it's name is decided by compiler (Internally), which extends super class and override the method..


	Local Inner Class :
-> 	A class which created in class and in the method that is known as Local Inner class..


	Static Nested Class :
-> A static class that is declared inside the class that is known as Static nested class..
-> It can access private and static data members of outer class but it can not be access non-static data members..


	Nested Interface :
-> A interface is created inside interface or class..
-> The nested or Inner interface is must be public, if it is created in interface, but if it is created in class then it can be anything...
